Water, Earth, Fire, Air. Long ago the four nations lived together in harmony. 
But everything changed when the FIRE NATION attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, can stop them.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished...
A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender names Aang. And although his airbending skills are great,
he has still a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe, Aang can save the world!
